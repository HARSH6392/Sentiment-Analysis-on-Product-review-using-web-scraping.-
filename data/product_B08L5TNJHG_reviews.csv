 Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.
Build quality was great as always from Apple.
Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I’m happy with the blue colour “ not bad at all and not too flashy”
Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient as a normal user.
If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.
There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it’s my personal opinion as a long time apple user)
As you all know iPhone 12 won’t comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)
I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900
I don’t judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.
I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.
A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.
Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I’m completely satisfied with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.
My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.
Thank you Apple India

Anupam,Reviewed in India on 7 January 2021,"Extremely disappointed with this phone. It’s a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple’s trickery and gimmickry.

The battery doesn’t last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won’t be enough for anyone.

And then there are other apple quirks - won’t come with a SD card, won’t come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won’t work with this one. Face ID won’t work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you’re out and vulnerable. This phone won’t allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn’t use. You won’t be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won’t let you.

Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn’t cost you more than 12 to 14K.

Apple is going down!

Amazon won’t take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone.",Verified Purchase,1
Paras,Reviewed in India on 13 November 2020,"This was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.
Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.
The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.
Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.

Elliot,Reviewed in India on 9 November 2020,"Hello there,
I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-
Memory
Build quality
Camera
Processor
Display
Except battery there’s rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,
iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here’s some condition that you should aware about
1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.
2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you’re on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.
Here’s some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know “How to save battery on iPhone 12” this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.
For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don’t have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.

I was very much confused between iphone 11 and this one as the price of iphone dropped ... But i am glad i chose this over iphone 11.
1.Display:
Main upgrade in iphone 12 is the oled display. Boy o boy the screen is amazing. I have user many android flagship's but this beats them all.
2.Battery:
Battery is amazing. I am getting 1.5 days of battery life with my usage.
PS: i dont play games.
3.IOS:
This is my 1st iphone and the experience with ios is great ... Very smooth animations ..even though its not 90hz screen but everything is buttery smooth.
4. Camera:
The pics from this phone is superb. FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.
5 Build &Design :
This phone looks and feels very premium compared to other phones.Very comfotable to use.
6.Face Id:
Face id works very fast and accurate in low lighting conditions.
7.Updates:
Ios14 is good and we can expect another 4yrs of software updates thats huge !

Cons:
1.Priced very high but it may be because of high taxes and custom duty.
2.No charger and earpods in the box.
3.Notifications are a mess ...android is better in managing new notifications.

RakhuNathan,Reviewed in India on 18 December 2020,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.

Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)

Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items. But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?

Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.

I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.

Good vegetable,Reviewed in India on 24 December 2020,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ₹ 84900. After credit card discount(₹6000), old phone exchange(₹3450) and reward points money(₹4530) inclusion, I bought it for ₹70920. There’s also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn’t let go of blue

1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it’d cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn’t seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.

2: DISPLAY: I’ve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.

3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.

How to choose between 64/128gb:
If you’re not really tight on budget, I’d suggest to go for 128gb variant. I’ve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage occupied about 60gb. So it’d make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.

CONS:
1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price
2. If you’re an android user, migration would be little time consuming

Shreyas Zad,Reviewed in India on 8 November 2020,"I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.

Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.

I’ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.

Pros:
1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.
2. The speed, the performance.
3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don’t usually need any professional touch.
4. Battery life - I’ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don’t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don’t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.

Cons

Aashik Francis,Reviewed in India on 4 August 2021,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I’ve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive.
If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.

Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021), apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra. If you read a few reviews you’ll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues and 9pro cameras didn’t live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.

Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:

1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)
2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag
3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality
4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand
5. The haptics are spot on

What’s Missing: (Minor misses though)
1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you’ll get used to it.
2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change
3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensor

Wait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:
It took a while for 12’s prices to fall. If you’re willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.

64GB or 128GB:
The difference is around ₹6000. 64GB if you don’t play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128😊

Battery:
I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to it’s competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.

Android Flagship Option:
The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.

Hope this review helped :)

Update:

13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That’s it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.

iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12’s launch price(86k). If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k). However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.

Sanjib M.,Reviewed in India on 21 January 2021,"From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.

As per the limitations :

1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)
2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.
3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)
4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)
5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)

Advantages:

1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.
2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)
3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)
4. The design and in-hand feel.
5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.

Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)

On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.
But iPhone 12 in 2020? its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.
If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience.",Verified Purchase,4
Abhishek James,Reviewed in India on 14 November 2020,"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.
All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.
The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.

Review after 10 months of use.

This pastel green is a treat to the eye

A14 bionic chip is a boss.
Easily compete with 1 year newer snapdragon chips in gaming & thermal management.

Camera ISP of apple are under appreciated

- Video recording performance is unmatched.
(Though there are better androids for still clicks/zoom like pixel & galaxy)

Much lighter than older 11, XR & XS series.. in weight & volume. Easy to grip!

- You don’t know the pain of owing an iphone until you break it’s screen. (No experience though xp)
So ceramic-hardened display is a nice add!

Considering iphone 13 are out u can grab 12 at a price drop 😌
If camera is most important, go for 13 eyes closed (much larger physical sensor)

Evaluate Price to value ratio^

Pros :
5nm chip (thermals, efficient)
Face ID (but pain during pandemic)
Good speakers
A14 (only 2 to 3 app on the entire app store that push the gpu to its limit)
OLED (for apple it’s still a feature lol)
Build to last
Holds value
Lags only once a years (pun intended) 😂
Finally good battery life.
Top 99% in silicon & camera among all phones.
5 year OS/security updates
Starting 12 series apple uses Qualcomm modems instead of trash intel ones (good signal)

Cons:
4GB RAM, really apple?
(Supper smooth but doesn't hold when keeping multiple heavy apps open at once)
iOS lacks customisation & consumes a lot of data than android for similar tasks on cellular.
No 120hz
Not price friendly at launch (not gonna make a kidney joke..)
Indian taxes aside apple still exploits pricing.

To sum it up, u will cherish this purchase!
Skip 11 or below… if not sure hold on till iphone SE 3 with A15 ..might launch in 2022.

Dipanjan Roychoudhary,Reviewed in India on 4 December 2020,"Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.
And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again. FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.
SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?
THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in android
and lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.

Pro Apple
1. Tons of privacy features and solid implementation. Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.
And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud.

2. Battery
The battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.

3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.

4. Build Quality - SOLID.

5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be ""raam bharose"", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.

6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.

Pro Android / Anti - iOS
1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.

2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.

3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.

4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.

5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.

6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.

7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.

I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now.",Verified Purchase,3
Piyush Kumar,Reviewed in India on 23 July 2021,"First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.

Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.
It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-

iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.

let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-
1. Notifications
- You can't reply through notifications.
- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)
- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).
- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.

2. App library
- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.

3. whatsapp
- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.
- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.
- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)
- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.

The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.

I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.
I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing.",Verified Purchase,3

Ranit Kumar Dholey,Reviewed in India on 27 September 2021,"This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.
I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.
Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.

I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.
And boy was I surprised . Let’s take up the review in sections.
1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .

2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it’s only for social media and you are not printing really big.

3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it’s average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.

4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.

5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.

Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended.",Verified Purchase,5

Amazon Customer,Reviewed in India on 7 December 2020,"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone.

prajith kj,Reviewed in India on 8 February 2022,"I am writing this, so nobody else end up in my situation. Bought a brand new iphone 12 from amazon for republic day sale. The product was defective , storage issues were there. System data itself was consuming 50 gb of total space so my phone was immediately full.

Called Amazon support as it was within replacement period, they asked for a service denial report from apple service centre. When I checked with the service centre they informed apple never shares a service denial letter . And by my logic it was reasonable as how can apple deny service for their own product under warranty. Anyways amazon was useless , no support provided stating some strange reasons (service denial letter) !!

Took this to apple service centre (iplanet vr mall bangalore) they kept my phone for 14 days doing nothing. They confirmed the phone is defective at the first place but was not able to support as it is a software glitch. They want me to escalate it through apple support only. Irony is I submitted it in service centre as per the suggestion by apple online support.

Dhruv,Reviewed in India on 15 March 2022,"While the iPhone 11 is an amazing device, without doubt, yet it has an IPS display. Older iPhone X and iPhone XS had OLED displays. Apple returned to OLED again with iPhone 12, although the refresh rate is at 60Hz. For those, who have not used devices with 90Hz or 120Hz, you would not notice any differences. Moving from an older iPhone with IPS display to iPhone 12, and you would immediately notice the crisp blacks. Battery size physically is less than the iPhone 11, yet Apple tweaks the A14 Bionic coupled with the iOS, which easily stretches the charge for 10-12hrs. on regular usage. Those heavily into web browsing, gaming etc. may not have such a long run with a single charge, yet it is capable enough for a pretty long day, without the need to plug in to the outlet. Oh, and yes, iPhone 12 comes with a USB-C to Lightning cable, but no charger. You will need to get a USB-C charger separately, either from Apple or other brands. Else, you can use your Qi charger, if you have one already.
iPhone 12 also has a more boxy look, a throwback to the iconic iPhone 4 days. Overall, as with any Apple phone, it is an amazing device, if you use your smartphone for all the regular usage like apps, gaming, web browsing. And yes, it can send messages.

Vineet,Reviewed in India on 10 February 2022,"I was an Android user and had high hopes with this Apple gadget, however after 8 months of using this so hyped Apple device, I can finally say that an iPhone is similar to a Shadi ka ladoo — jo Khaaye wo pachtaaye aur jo na khaye wo bhi pachtaaye. The reason I am saying this is because this phone lacks even the most basic features that even a 5k android phone has, like - call recording - which I eventually realised that it should have been an Apple feature instead of third party apps - which demand money and are pretty inconvenient to use.

The second drawback is that call logs are auto erased and kept up to a certain stack size (100 / 102) and if you want to go back to pull any earlier call logs beyond this specified stack size, you won’t be able to do so and will have to rely on your network provider (if you are eligible) for the same.

These are two very ground level use cases that fail to deliver in an Apple device and since I faced real life situations surrounding these two scenarios I feel that I it is not worth having this Phone and better to keep your “Android” pants on.

Then I thought why I bought this phone in the first place and got my answer -

1. Camera ??
Android phones are easily competing nicely with iPhone Camera now-a-days and some have even better camera.

2. Brand marketing / re-selling value / durability ??
I am so over it now after 8 months of usage and the price keeps on sinking down as newer model enters the market so not a wise call I must say

Lav,Reviewed in India on 30 December 2020,"I used to use an Android phone till 2014 and wanted to switch to iOS, so the same year I bought iPhone 6, It was good to have an iOS device and the performance and the cameras but those were sufficient only until next year when 6s launched. Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.
As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.
Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.
When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.
I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.
INR 3000₹ Discount on the colour white, plus 6000₹ HDFC instant discount. Effective price 76000₹. Unfortunately Charging Brick isn't included and it coasted 1900₹ more for 20W USB-C from Apple India website.

Excellent camera quality, great design and screen quality. The A14 processor is super fast and the phone never heats up even while performing intensive tasks. The speakers are very loud and clear and give out high quality sound.
One problem I encountered is that the battery life is not great but definitely above average. Another issue is the notch which makes the phone look outdated especially in 2021. The Face ID is also not useful while wearing masks which causes a lot of inconvenience since the phone doesn’t have a fingerprint scanner.

I was upgrading from iphone 7 which served me well for 4 years, which I exchanged for this.

The delivery & exchange formalities were smooth.

The phone itself is surely an upgrade when compared to 7, the display is top notch, the camera is probably the best there is, the face unlock works like a charm, what's to say about the best phone, it works even better than advertised.

The only problem like always is the battery which hardly lasts a day & charging time is also an issue, it tends to heat up a little while charging but with the previous experience with iphone 7, the longevity of the phone is guaranteed with the timely updates from Apple, the premium which an iphone demands stands justified with a superior product.

Some people tried to discourage me from buying an iphone from Amazon claiming warranty & support issues. But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.

Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty. Do remember to do this within 3 months of your purchase.",Verified Purchase,4

Vignesh Bhasker,Reviewed in India on 1 June 2021,"I have been an apple user for the past 10 years and this is the first phone which is disappointing. I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.

1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.

2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR

3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.

4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.

5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.

6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.

7. again no ear phones.

8. It somehow doesn't have the wow factor as what the X had.

Update.

I exchange my phone for a 12 mini. much more easier to use with one hand and comfortable.",Verified Purchase,3

Saptarshi Dutt,Reviewed in India on 3 April 2021,"Excellent phone, only reason I have reduced one star is since Amazon reduced the price by Rs 3000 the day after I received the phone and this really hurts after spending so much of my hard earned money. Exchange value received for my older phone was also pretty inadequate, considering the condition it was in.

Pros:
1. The green colour is gorgeous
2. Cameras are outstanding
3. Battery life is really good, lasts me almost 2 days on a charge
4. Screen is very bright and has vibrant colours
5. Speaker is very loud

Cons:
1. Just nitpicking, but a fingerprint sensor would have been much more convenient during Covid
2. Indian variant doesn't have the mmWave antenna, inspite of being more expensive than the US Variant

...who else,Reviewed in India on 2 April 2021,"Yes, it is a 5 star phone. But if you are moving from android to iPhone please be ready to lose your freedom. There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.
Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.
For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.

- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.
- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.
- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume and gives awesome vibe while listening to music
- iOS has no bugs at all
- 20W charging is lit 🔥

Aman Srivastava,Reviewed in India on 11 December 2020,"I was an avid android user for past 25 years. This move to IPhone 12 was a calculative yet bolder definitive move.

Let’s look at the some of key pointers here what I saw -
- Stunning design and spectacular OLed display pouring out all the vivid colors
- Smooth app flow and transitions
- Longer battery life 7-8 hrs without automation (best in my usage)
- Camera is just bringing the life out of all the captures you make.

*I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It’s almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, “The best switch one can make”. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.

*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.
*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving.",Verified Purchase,5

Apple should seriously work on this battery part.",Verified Purchase,3

Hari Narayan,Reviewed in India on 11 February 2022,"What I Liked.
1) Weight Balancing
2) Battery Optimisation
3) Software update upon unboxing
4) Camera and Security features

What I didn't like
1) Limitations of common Charger. I have to use different charging cables for my iPhone, while my iPad Pro, Samsung Buds etc share a USB C cable.
2) Some advertised features require the support of additional devices of Apple Eco System. For example, Apple said with iOS 15.3 face ID will work even with Masks On. But I just learned that this feature works only if you have an iWatch also.
3) Not a gamer, but still for this price point at least a 90Hz refresh was desirable.
4) Front Camera, sometimes have not of noise (nitpicking)

At the end of the day, I am happy with my purchase. But I strongly recommend this phones to enthusiasts and upgraders only.",Verified Purchase,5

The display started lagging and and at times the device was completely unresponsive leading to unexpected shutdowns all this happened in merely 5 days of using it. And upon contacting customer support I was informed by Ms. Tuleshwari from support team to connect with Brand and in case the brand is ready to issue a service report they will initiate the replacement request. Upon getting the service report done from Apple service centre the support team staff Mr. Sanjay on outright basis denied replacment stating we cant issue basis the report. It's the brand who will have to be contacted. Customer service and support is clearly lacking with a brand like Amazon. What's the point of claiming of a free 7 day replacement policy when the support team clearly twists it as per their own convenience.

Pros: Amazing look, feel, display, very smooth touch and face recognition is ‘the best’. Lot of new features in camera like studio light, night mode etc.

Just 2 cons: Little small in size as compared to oneplus 6T and battery life is upto my expectation.

If anyone really want to switch to iphone, this is a great deal

A great buy. Delivery by Amazone was good got it on fourth day even in this lockdown time. Face unlock works like a charm when you are not using mask. Battery life is ok but don’t expect like those huge 4500mah like endurance of androids for that you have to spend a bit extra and go for iPhone pro Max.,Verified Purchase,5
