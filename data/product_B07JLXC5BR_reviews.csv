Sameer Dhingra,Reviewed in India on 31 March 2020,"This is a great camera. It's a small form factor and I absolutely love how light it is and the pictures it takes just out of the box are amazing. However, the USB data cable that comes with it is Panasonic proprietary cable. Understandably this camera came out in 2015 so back then USB-C wasn't as common... so we're stuck with this weird cable that if you lose, the likelihood of easily finding another is so less. I lost mine and I am stuck unable to transfer pictures to my laptop from this... the SD card reader in my laptop is busted and until I buy a new (USB) one of those, I can't transfer pictures. Am I dumb? Yes. But is this camera also dumb? Totally.",Verified Purchase,4

Manjunath R.,Reviewed in India on 27 June 2021,"It is the best camera available at this cost. I have an Online educational institution and I shoot 4 to 6 hours three days a week. It runs continuously for 89 minutes in MTS format without getting overheated. It has an external mic slot. I use a Boya condenser mic. And I get sharp voice record.

Arkadipta Mal,Reviewed in India on 20 February 2021," The first photos that you are seeing are taken with the camera and with 14-42mm kit lens.......
This camera is definitely a very good camera for beginners....
This camera also performs good in low light even with kit lens
You need to bump up iso to 6400
A little noise can come
But that's not a big issue as u can fix that in post processing or in editing software
Also the battery backup is pretty good
As it last around a day with full charge and it takes 3hrs to charge

To get the most out of this camera
Use the following settings
Back dial- for exposure
Shutter dial- for respective control in the mode(like aperture in A or shutter in S)

Then use F1 button for auto focus
As it can come handy while using manual focus

Use F3 for digital zoom

And you can use the HYDN mode in bright sunlight as it has wider dynamic range and in some cases better skin tones (sometimes the skintones look worse)

I mostly use A for photography
And A in manual movie mode also,
Some photos of my settings are also attached.....",Verified Purchase,5

Jeetendra G,Reviewed in India on 3 November 2021,"Excellent Quality, Excellent Packaging and Excellent on performance. I researched a lot on the internet before buying this camera. When the product arrived, I was amazed at how sturdily the product was packaged and handled. I had to use scissors and knife to cut the external packaging. The product came as promised with all items properly packed. Installed the battery and lens with ease. Installed the strap also with ease. Although I would recommend Panasonic to provide a thick strap with metal hooks. I would request users not to dangle the strap on your neck or shoulders. Always let your hand be on the camera also to prevent accidental falls etc.

I have shot some amazing cinematic videos and photographs for personal as well as corporate use. The camera has a user friendly interface and tells you via the red icon if the settings for a shot are not correct and then you can adjust the shutter speed and focal length and take the shots or video. The 4K video is amazing and gives you cinematic look. You can shoot videos in full color or in the Cine D or Cine V profiles and color it using color grading software. You are the boss so make whatever setting you want as per the content you are shooting. This camera makes videography and photography fun. It has Aperture priority mode for bokeh, Shutter priority mode for action shots. Long shots with long shutter speed. The factory supplied lens 14-42 mm is good enough because its both a close up and wide angle lens. Excellent quality and value for money.",Verified Purchase,5

DRS,Reviewed in India on 27 February 2020,"I bought this for Rs.47,000/- next month they made it Rs.35,000. WTH ??? Companies shouldnt just drop price so drastically that it ruins our investment. There should be a gradual decrease.

PLz note my following review is entirely based on video on this camera as i didnt buy it for stills. Only a fool would buy this for stills as for the same price you can get an awesome Canon/Nikon DSLR which will have a much larger sensor giving you lovely shallow DOF and color reproduction.

Anyway, this camera gives you 4K quality that can almost look like a Redmi phone's 4K recording. Horrible green tinged or bluish tinged footage. So bad is its inherent white balance and color temp handling. No amount of tweaking will get you out. Panasonic cant beat Canons color science and natural color that you get from Canon DSLRs. Dont trust all the YouTube videos you see etc. They have shot those in scenes where the bluish tinge adds to the appeal. But show me good skin tone shots with this camera. Very rare to see. Unless you invest in a very costly lens maybe.

Also in a DSLR, lets say you want to have a certain wide angle lens, say that lens for your DSLR costs you X amount. For the same effect (with no shallow DOF bec of its miniature sensor in the G7) and angle of view in the G7 the lens will cost 3 times as much.

Im planning to shoot myself for buying this utter waste of a camera. Only after buying it did i realize that the color tinge etc wont accomodate for all types of shots. Whereas in a DSLR you can do cool temp shots and lovely warm shots. The amount of noise in the video (color & luma noise dots on the video for laymen to understand) even in average and well lit rooms will drive you crazy. Especially with yellow pale walls and browns. The final will be murky and with rough noise in it.

How do i know all this. 9 years of experience in Photography & Videography. Trust me or not, dont ever buy this. You can go for a full frame or APSC size mirrorless camera instead from makers like Sony/Canon/Nikon etc.

Thanks for reading this. And wish you all a sensible purchase.",,1
